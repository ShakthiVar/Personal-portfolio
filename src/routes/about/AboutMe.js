        I am a front-end web developer and android developer with 2 years of working experience. 
        I am a Google Developer Students Club Lead and managed around 30 members in leading Projects,
        to achieve results. I enjoy creating beautiful, accessible, and
        responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Effective use of time, problem-solving, and
        communication skills help me show a positive attitude in complex
        situations, and my desire to learn quickly adapts me to changing
        situations.
